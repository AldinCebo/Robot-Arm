Robot manipulation guided by ultrasonic sensor

A system consisting of a robot manipulator, microprocessor and sensor is described. The mathematical model of the robotic manipulators was solved using direct and inverse kinematics. Direct kinematics has been solved using the Denavit-Hartenberg method and inverse kinematics by Pieper's solution. Program solutions for direct and inverse kinematics are also described. An ultrasonic sensor is used for 2D mapping of the robot's environment. The problem of 2D mapping by ultrasonic sensor is described and a program solution si presented. The full program code is written in MATLAB programming language. The Arduino Mega 2560 microprocessor is also described and used in this work. A graphical interface is created using GUIDE tool of MATLAB and it is connected to the microprocessor which controls the robot manipulator.
